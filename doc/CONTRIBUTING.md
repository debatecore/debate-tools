# Contributing

## Branch naming

When creating a branch, link it to an issue. If there's no issue regarding changes you want to implement, create one. The branch name should comply with the following convention:

```
issue-number-issue-name
```

For example:

```
43-add-contributing.md
```

## Commit messages

The commit messages should begin with the branch/issue number:

```
[issue number] commit message
```

For example:

```
[43] create contributing.md
```
